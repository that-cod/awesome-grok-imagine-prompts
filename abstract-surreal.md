| Breathing Fractal | {"title": "Glass Sphere with Inner Cube-Fractal Lung", "image": {"prompt": "Clear glass sphere with soft, clean speculars floats in front of a black backplate; inside, a small cube-lattice (Menger-like) with soft bevels hangs at the center; faint internal haze reveals gentle light shafts. Action–Lighting–Style: interior cube scales in a breath-like rhythm (action), soft backlight plus subtle overhead key to shape the orb (lighting), minimalist monochrome surrealism (style).", "negative_prompt": "color, text, letters, logos, watermark, scratches, fingerprints, heavy caustics, moiré, aliasing, banding, mirror-like chrome", "style": "surreal photoreal CGI, minimalist, monochrome", "composition": {"framing": "centered", "angle": "eye-level", "lens": "50mm", "subject_scale": "medium"}, "palette": "strict grayscale (#000000–#FFFFFF)"}, "animation": {"motion_type": "subject-internal", "camera": "slow 12° arc right-to-left (no zoom)", "intensity": "low", "beats": ["Establish: sphere stable, inner cube neutral", "Inhale: inner cube scales up ~3–4%, shafts tighten slightly", "Exhale: inner cube relaxes to neutral silhouette for loop"], "duration_seconds": 6, "constraints": {"max_characters": 0, "avoid_text_in_scene": true, "parametric": "sine-wave scaling", "scale_range_percent": "96–104"}}, "lighting": {"mood": "calm, pristine", "time_of_day": "studio", "quality": "soft backlight halo with gentle top key; keep haze minimal to avoid banding"}, "subject": {"description": "Glass orb with an inner breathing cube-lattice; exterior remains rigid", "action": "internal rhythmic scale", "identity_rules": "purely abstract; no faces"}, "environment": {"location": "void black", "atmosphere": "very light internal haze; no external particles"}, "audio": {"mood": "ambient", "elements": ["low sub swell", "soft glass room hush"], "notes": "no melody or vocals; keep gentle and spacious"}, "constraints": {"prevent_style_drift": true, "avoid_artifacts": true, "complexity": "low"}, "output": {"aspect_ratio": "9:16", "resolution": "1080x1920", "fps": 24, "loop": true}, "safety": {"nsfw": "off", "no_likeness_of_real_people": true, "no_children": true}} | Looping abstract animation; grayscale for calm. |
| Neon Heart | The image is a beautiful heart. Extreme intense neon color transformations loop. It must say “GROK”. | Brand fun; video: add pulsing beats. |
| Steaming Magic | A steaming cup of cappuccino on a polished golden table, where the rising steam transforms into a magical swirl of blooming sunflowers, daisies, and plump raspberries, interwoven with glowing golden particles that shimmer like tiny stars. The latte art in the foam subtly forms a heart shape, evoking warmth and whimsy. | Whimsical transform; close-up lens. |
| Hand Blueprints | Anatomical hand blueprints written on parchment in english. | Educational surreal; aged paper texture. |
| Dynamic Pose | A stylish woman with voluminous hair, captured in a dynamic pose while sitting on a wooden stool in a retro-inspired interior. The sunlight streams through sheer curtains, casting dramatic shadows on the patterned wallpaper and carpet. She is dressed in a modern white outfit, exuding elegance and confidence. Cinematic warm tones and high-contrast lighting. | Abstract fashion; shadow play key. |
