| Title | Prompt | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Brighten Up | Hey, this pic’s way too dim—can you lighten it up? Make it feel all sunny and happy, like a perfect day. | Mood lift; great for dull shots. |
| Bold Colors | The colors are decent, but I want them to really jump out at me—can you boost them so they’re super bold and lively? | Vibrancy amp; avoid oversaturation. |
| Pop Contrast | Everything’s kinda mushy here—can you tweak the contrast? I want the details to pop so I can actually see what’s happening. | Clarity boost; edge sharpening. |
| Purple Fade | The background’s blah and boring—how about switching it to something cool, like a deep purple fade? That’d look so much better. | Backdrop swap; gradient smooth. |
| Center Crop | There’s all this extra junk around the edges—can you chop it down to just the guy in the center? He’s the star of the show anyway. | Focal trim; rule of thirds. |
| Add Sports Car | This needs some pizzazz—how about sticking a slick red sports car over on the side? That’d totally kick it up a notch! | Element insert; scale match. |
| Soaring Birds | The sky’s just sitting there—can you throw in some birds soaring around? It’d make it feel more alive and free. | Life add; motion blur if video. |
| Zap Tree | That tree on the right is bugging me—it’s blocking everything. Can you zap it out of there? | Removal clean; inpaint seamless. |
| Good Vibes Text | I want this to say something—can you add big, chunky white letters at the top that say ‘Good Vibes Only’? That’d set the mood. | Typography overlay; font bold. |
| Cute Beagle | This pic’s missing some cuteness—how about popping in a scruffy little beagle right up front? I’d melt every time I see it! | Pet insert; expression playful. |
