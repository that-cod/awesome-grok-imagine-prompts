| Title | Prompt | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Autumn Rider | A cool guy on a motorcycle with a bushy beard riding down an autumn windy road on a clear day. | Captures motion blur on leaves; add "golden hour lighting" for warmth. |
| Misty Graveyard | Photorealistic snapshot of a drizzly autumn morning in a remote coastal graveyard: weathered granite headstones leaning slightly amid overgrown grass and brambles, sea mist rolling in from the horizon; a solitary crow perches on a rusted iron fence post, head cocked unnaturally still, wings half-unfurled as if listening—gentle bokeh on dew-kissed spiderwebs in the foreground, desaturated grays and muted browns, no dramatic shadows or supernatural flares. | Atmospheric horror vibe; negative: "bright colors" for mood control. |
| Glacier Dragon | {"subject": "Massive ancient dragon embedded in a glacier wall", "description": "A colossal, pale blue dragon partially entombed in ice, wings wrapped tightly around its body like a sarcophagus. Its skull is exposed, jaw half open, with rows of serrated teeth coated in frost. Cracks in the glacier glow faintly with bioluminescence, and faint breath escapes its nostrils as if dormant, not dead.", "environment": "Frozen crevasse in arctic wasteland, ice cliffs stretching into distance, blizzard haze in the air", "lighting": "Cold, diffuse ambient light with harsh highlights on ice, pale blue glow from within cracks", "camera": {"shot_type": "overhead drone shot with steep angle", "lens": "70mm equivalent, wide frame for full creature and terrain", "focus": "sharp on dragon’s face and wings, motion blur in falling snow"}, "style": "ultra-realistic ancient creature photography, arctic survival realism", "mood": "dormant terror, frozen divinity"} | JSON-structured for precision; extend to video with "slow ice crack animation." |
| Gothic Woman | Cinematic portrait of a gothic woman with pale skin and jet-black hair, abrasive authenticity, ambient occlusion, depth of field, black and white color palette, her piercing eyes framed by dramatic eyeliner. | Monochrome drama; pair with "rim lighting" for edge. |
| Tribal Warrior | A young woman with intricate tribal tattoos on her arms, wearing intricately painted armor adorned with luminous pearl-white ornaments, standing in a futuristic space with microcircuits casting a soft violet glow, framed in a wide, cinematic perspective showcasing the vastness of the high-tech environment. | Blends realism with subtle sci-fi; 16:9 for epic feel. |
| Velvet Lounge | Elegant indoor portrait of a stylish young woman lounging on a bright red velvet sofa in a cozy study room filled with bookshelves and blue-and-white ceramic vases. She has short dark hair, flawless skin, and wears a blue floral bra top with red floral high-waist shorts, and shiny gold platform boots. Sunlight filters softly through white curtains, creating a warm, golden glow on her skin and highlighting the rich red tones of the sofa. The composition feels refined yet sensual, cinematic and perfectly balanced, vintage glamour meets modern fashion photography. Realistic lighting, sharp focus, high detail, 8K ultra-realism, filmic tone. | Fashion editorial; add "bokeh books" for depth. |
| Nightclub Confidence | A young adult female in an indoor nightclub, exuding confidence with a short black pixie cut, wearing a black bralette, leopard beret, chunky oxidized silver necklace, eclectic rings, and a feather shawl with bold tribal tattoos. Her bold makeup features glittery eyelids and matte red lipstick, captured in a medium close-up with eye-level flash photography. The lighting is warm with soft amber glows, casting delicate shadows to enhance the moody, vintage 2000s atmosphere. Blurred partygoers in vibrant jewel-toned outfits in the background add liveliness, with warm browns, gold, black, and tan tones in a 3:4 aspect ratio, 8K realism. | Retro party energy; negative: "overexposed flash." |
| Vanity Glow | A cinematic portrait of a young East Asian woman sitting gracefully at a white marble vanity table. She has long, sleek, dark brown hair parted in the middle, styled simply to frame her face. Her skin is luminous and smooth with a warm tone. She wears soft, peach-toned makeup with a light shimmer on the eyelids, winged eyeliner, and coral lipstick that gives her a polished glow. She’s dressed in an off-shoulder black velvet dress that accentuates her neckline and shoulders, elegant yet modern. A delicate silver necklace with a small pendant rests on her collarbone, and she wears matching silver earrings and a ring, adding a refined touch. Her posture is confident and feminine, one arm resting naturally on the marble surface, the other relaxed by her side. The scene takes place in a softly lit vanity space with a mirror reflecting part of her silhouette. The lighting is balanced and diffused, creating a clean, luxurious look, soft shadows, no harsh highlights, and a smooth skin texture. On the vanity, there are makeup items such as a compact palette, a small decorative brush, and bottles of foundation neatly placed beside her. The background features deep navy or dark curtains and minimalist decor, including white vases filled with dried flowers in warm autumn hues of orange, cream, and gold. The overall mood feels elegant, poised, and quietly glamorous, like a high-end beauty editorial captured on a crisp modern camera with cinematic lighting and 8K ultra-realistic clarity. Color palette: ivory white, black velvet, warm peach tones, and soft gold floral accents. Aspect ratio: 4:5. Style: hyper-realistic, luxury portrait, magazine aesthetic. | Beauty routine serenity; 4:5 for portrait mode. |
| Psychedelic Gaze | Portrait photography with a sense of design, psychedelic cold light blue tones, butterfly light, close-up shot of a young white woman. She has high-level short black hair, raised eyebrows on the right, thick eyelashes, high nose bridge, biting red lips, and staring disdainfully at the camera. The camera pulls back, and the foreground is broken glass in the air, which blocks part of the woman's face. | Edgy surrealism; add shards for tension. |
| Winter Charm | In the winter valley where the snow is falling, a bright and beautiful young white woman in a close-up shot turns her head sideways to look at the camera. She has long black wavy hair, a pointed chin, bushy raised eyebrows, deep eye sockets, red eyes, dark eyeshadow and upturned eyeliner, straight nose, thick lips, very bright red lips, clear jaw line, very long nails, red manicure. The woman is wearing a black robe, wearing a hat to cover her eyebrows, and the collar is slightly open with clear collarbone. Her eyes are fixed on the camera, and her eyes are very attractive. The background is green vegetation covered with thick snow, and snowflakes fall in the air. The camera slightly surrounds the woman to the left, and the woman raises her right hand on her chin, looking at the camera with a charming smile. | Snowy allure; video tip: "gentle snow drift." |
| Cyborg Peace | Female cyborg in a reflective chrome bodysuit with seams, short metallic-blue bob haircut, calm expression, one hand on hip, the other making a peace sign; behind her, futuristic white guns float mid-air around a glowing holographic mesh; scene lit from below with cold bluish light fading into shadow, in the style of Masamune Shirow’s Ghost in the Shell cover art. | Sci-fi portrait; holographic glow video tip. |
